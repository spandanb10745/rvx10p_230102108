# ‚öôÔ∏è RVX10-P: Design and Verification Report

---

## üß© 1. Design Description

The **RVX10-P** is a **5-stage pipelined implementation** of the single-cycle **RVX10** core.  
It implements the full **RV32I** base instruction set plus **10 custom RVX10 ALU operations**:

`ANDN, ORN, XNOR, MIN, MAX, MINU, MAXU, ROL, ROR, ABS`

The datapath is partitioned into five stages:
**IF ‚Üí ID ‚Üí EX ‚Üí MEM ‚Üí WB**, with pipeline registers between stages and dedicated hazard/forwarding units.

## üß™ Verification and Waveforms

### Test 1: Primary Test Program

The primary test program runs a series of instructions and, if all are correct, finishes by storing the value **25** at memory address **100**. The simulation output confirms this success.

### Test 2: `x0` Register Integrity

The `x0` register is hardwired to zero. A test instruction (`add x0,x2,x9` in 0x78 PC) was executed to confirm that its value cannot be overwritten. Waveforms show the write attempt through EX, MEM, WB, but the register file prevents the write.

Back-to-back ALU operations were tested to verify forwarding.

**Test 1:**

- `x3` value not yet in register file, forwarded from `ALUResultM`

**Test 2:**
- `add x7,x4,x5` in 0x2C PC followed by `sub x7,x7,x2`  in 0x30 PC
- Forwarded ALU result ensures correct computation

**Summary table**

| Core | Cycles | Instructions | CPI |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Single-Cycle RVX10 | 29 | 29 | 1.00 |
| Pipelined RVX10-P | 39 | 31 | 1.256 |
> 35 cycles as for theory for 31 instructions, the formula is (n-1+k) where k are the stages and n is the total no. of instructions.
> As for n = 31 , it should come to be total cycles as 35 cycles but for 1 branch and 1 jump success. There will be 4 penalties.
> 31 instructions as two are not to be executed due to 1 branch success and 1 jump success.
> Note: pipeline fill/drain and stalls cause CPI > 1; the pipelined design still wins in time because of shorter clock period per stage.

## üîß Improvements & Future Work

![Benchmark Placeholder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6952c882-4510-4698-9f61-ace036f2e8b3)


During testing, the **RVX10-P** core achieved **39 cycles for 31 instructions**, giving an **average CPI ‚âà 1.258**.  
However, this result is **abstract** ‚Äî it was not based on a standardized benchmark suite but rather on a self-constructed instruction sequence.
Now I can also design a testbench which contains 51 instructions containing only 2 branch instructions that are successful. So by theoretical calculations I will get CPI as 59/51= 1.156.
So, In my testbench as you keep branch and jump instructions constant and increase the testbench by adding instructions other than branch, jump or load, you can potentially even reach nearer to 1 CPI.

### üí° Proposed Improvement
A key next step would be to:
- **Design a dedicated benchmark-driven testbench**, simulating realistic instruction mixes (arithmetic, logic, load/store, branch, and jump operations).
- **Compare theoretical and practical CPI values**, refining the pipeline control and forwarding mechanisms to minimize stalls and bubbles.

### üß© Outcome
This enhancement would make the performance analysis more robust, allowing future iterations of **RVX10-P** to:
- Achieve **benchmark-consistent CPI values**
- **Validate real-world throughput efficiency**
- Strengthen the design‚Äôs credibility through **quantitative comparison** of simulated vs. theoretical results.
